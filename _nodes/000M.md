title: Avoiding the axiom of choice
macrolib: topos
---

In some cases we may avoid use of the axiom of choice in {%ref 000L%}; if our foundations allow us to
take the quotient of a *class* (e.g. using
[Scott's Trick](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Scott%27s+trick)), then we may
define a morphism $x\to y\in U$ to be given by the following data:

1. a cartesian map $a\to\Sub{x} \bar{u}$ over $x : 1\to U$,
2. a cartesian map $b\to\Sub{y} \bar{u}$ over $y : 1\to U$,
3. and a vertical map $h:a\to b$ in $\FAM{C}[1]\simeq C$,

such that $(a\Sub{1},b\Sub{1},h\Sub{1})$ is identified with $(a\Sub{2},b\Sub{2},h\Sub{2})$ when $h_1$ and $h_2$ are equal modulo the (unique) vertical isomorphisms between the cartesian lifts in the sense depicted below:
«
\begin{tikzpicture}[diagram]
  \SpliceDiagramSquare{
    nw = a_1,
    ne = a_2,
    sw = b_1,
    se = b_2,
    north = \cong,
    south = \cong,
    west = h_1,
    east = h_2,
    east/node/style = upright desc,
  }
  \node (u) [between = ne and se, xshift = 2cm] {$\bar{u}$};
  \draw[->] (ne) to node [sloped,above] {cart.}(u);
  \draw[->] (se) to node [sloped,below] {cart.} (u);
\end{tikzpicture}
»

Alternatively, if $C$ is locally small then we may take the quotient above without difficulty as sets are closed under quotients.
