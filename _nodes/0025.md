Let $E$ be a geometric universe. A $E$-*topos* $X$ or a *topos in
$E$* is defined to be a geometric universe $\Sh{X}$ equipped with a structure
map $X:E\to\Sh{X}$ whose gluing fibration $\GL{X}$ has a
small separator {%pref 002H%}. A morphism of $E$-topoi $f:{X}\to{Y}$ is defined by a
morphism $\Sh{f}:\Sh{Y}\to\Sh{X}$ of geometric universes equipped with
a 2-isomorphism $\phi_{f}:X \cong Y;\Sh{f}$ in $[E,\Sh{X}]$.

It will often be convenient to display pasting diagrams as *string diagrams*,
which we read in diagrammatic order from top left to bottom right. A string
diagram views 2-cell as a "transformer" through which information passes
along a wire; the input/output interface of such a transformer is written on
the wires. Regions of whitespace denote objects of the ambient 2-category.

      \node (phi/f/next/1) [below left = of phi/f] {};
      \node (phi/f/next/2) [below right = of phi/f] {};
      \draw (phi/f.north) ++ (0,1) to node [upright desc] {$X$} (phi/f.north);
      \draw (phi/f.south) to node [desc] {$Y$} (phi/f/next/1.north);

A 2-morphism $\alpha:{f}\to{g}$ in $[X,Y]$ is defined to be a
2-morphism $\alpha:\Sh{f}\to{\Sh{g}}$ compatible with $\phi_{f},\phi_{g}$
in the sense that the following pasting diagrams are equal:

  \begin{tikzpicture}[diagram,baseline=(S/X.base)]
    \node (E) {$E$};
    \node (S/Y) [below left = of E] {$\Sh{Y}$};
    \node (S/X) [below right = of E] {$\Sh{X}$};
    \draw[->] (E) to node [sloped,above] {$Y$} (S/Y);
    \draw[->] (S/Y) to node (S/f) [upright desc] {$\Sh{f}$} (S/X);
    \draw[->] (E) to node [sloped,above] {$X$} (S/X);
    \draw[->,bend right=60] (S/Y) to node (S/g) [below] {$\Sh{g}$} (S/X);
    \node [between = E and S/f] {$\phi_{f}$};
    \node [between = S/g.north and S/f] {$\alpha$};
  \end{tikzpicture}
  \qquad
  \begin{tikzpicture}[diagram,baseline=(S/X.base)]
    \node (E) {$E$};
    \node (S/Y) [below left = of E] {$\Sh{Y}$};
    \node (S/X) [below right = of E] {$\Sh{X}$};
    \draw[->] (E) to node [sloped,above] {$Y$} (S/Y);
    \draw[->] (E) to node [sloped,above] {$X$} (S/X);
    \draw[->,bend right=60] (S/Y) to node (S/g) [below] {$\Sh{g}$} (S/X);
    \node [between = S/Y and S/X] {$\phi_g$};

We may likewise represent the equation above in terms of string diagrams.
«
\begin{tikzpicture}[diagram]
  \node[draw,rectangle] (phi/f) {$\phi_f$};
  \node[below left = of phi/f] (phi/f/next/1) {};
  \node[draw,rectangle,below right = of phi/f] (alpha) {$\alpha$};
  \node[below = 1.5cm of alpha] (alpha/next) {};
  \draw (phi/f.north) ++ (0,1) to node [upright desc] {$X$} (phi/f.north);
  \draw (phi/f.south) to node [desc] {$Y$} (phi/f/next/1.north);
  \draw (phi/f.south) to node [desc] {$\Sh{f}$} (alpha.north);
  \draw[] (alpha) to node [upright desc] {$\Sh{g}$} (alpha/next.north);
\end{tikzpicture}
\qquad
\begin{tikzpicture}[diagram]
  \node[draw,rectangle] (phi/g) {$\phi_g$};
  \node (phi/g/next/1) [below left = of phi/g] {};
  \node (phi/g/next/2) [below right = of phi/g] {};
  \draw (phi/g.north) ++ (0,1) to node [upright desc] {$X$} (phi/g.north);
  \draw (phi/g.south) to node [desc] {$Y$} (phi/g/next/1.north);
  \draw (phi/g.south) to node [desc] {$\Sh{g}$} (phi/g/next/2.north);
\end{tikzpicture}
