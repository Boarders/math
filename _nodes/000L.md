**Theorem.** An ordinary category $C$ is equivalent to a globally small category if and only if the fibration $\FAM{C}$ has a generic object.

**Proof.**
To see that this is the case, suppose that $C$ has a set of objects. Then
$C\in\SET$ and we define $\lfloor{C}\rfloor$ to be the displayed object
$\brc{x}\Sub{x\in C}\in \FAM{C}[C]$. Fixing $I\in \SET$ and $z\in C^I$, we
consider the cartesian map displayed over $z : I \to C$:
«
\DiagramSquare{
  height = 1.5cm,
  width = 3cm,
  west/style = lies over,
  east/style = lies over,
  sw = I,
  se = C,
  south = z,
  ne = \brc{x}\Sub{x\in C},
  nw = {z = \brc{z\,i}\Sub{i\in I} }
}

Conversely assume that $\FAM{C}$ has a generic object $\bar{u}\in\FAM{C}[U]$
for some $U\in \SET$; then we may equip $U$ with the structure of a globally
small category, such that $U$ is equivalent to $C$.  By the axiom of choice we
may choose for each $x\in U$ a cartesian map
$\InvImg{x}\bar{u}\to\Sub{x}\bar{u}$ over $x:1\to U$; then we say that a
morphism $x\to y\in U$  is given by a vertical map $\InvImg{x}\bar{u}\to
\InvImg{y}\bar{u}$ in $\FAM{C}[1] \simeq C$.
