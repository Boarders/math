<meta name="description" content="Locally small fibrations [000F] There are a number of (equivalent) variations on the definition of a locally small fibration. We attempt to provide some intuition for these definitions. Warmup: locally small family fibrations [000G] An ordinary category $E$ is called locally small when for any $x,y\in E$ the collection of morphisms $x\to y$ is a set. This property of $E$ can be rephrased in terms of its family fibration [0004] $\FAM{E}$ over $\SET$ as follows. Consider an index set $I\in \SET$ and two families $u,v\in C^I$. We may define an $I$-indexed collection $[u,v]\Sub{i\in I}$ consisting (pointwise) of all the morphisms $u\Sub{i}\to v\Sub{i}$ in $C$: If $C$ is locally small, $[u,v]\Sub{i\in I}$ is in fact a family of sets for any $I\in\SET$ as each $[u,v]\Sub{i}$ is a set. Conversely, if $[u,v]\Sub{i\in I}$ is a family of sets for any $I\in \SET$, then $C$ is locally small as we may consider in particular the case that $I=\mathbf{1}$. A more abstract formulation [000H] We will reformulate the above in a way that uses only the language that makes sense for an arbitrary fibration, though for now we stick with $\FAM{C}$. Given $u,v\in \FAM{C}[I]$, we have a “relative hom family” $[u,v]\in\Sl{\SET}{I}$, defined in [000G]. The fact that each $[u,v]\Sub{i}$ is the set of all morphisms $u\Sub{i}\to v\Sub{i}$ can be rephrased more abstractly. First we consider the restriction of $u\in \FAM{C}[I]$ to $\FAM{C}[[u,v]]$ as follows: Explicitly the family $\InvImg{[u,v]}u$ is indexed in a pair of an element $i\in I$ and a morphism $u\Sub{i}\to v\Sub{i}$. We can think of $\InvImg{[u,v]}u$ as the object of elements of $u\Sub{i}$ indexed in pairs $(i,u\Sub{i}\to v\Sub{i})$. There is a canonical map $\epsilon\Sub{[u,v]}:\InvImg{[u,v]}u\to\Sub{p\Sub{[u,v]}} v$ that “evaluates” each indexing morphism $u\Sub{i}\to v\Sub{i}$. That each $[u,v]\Sub{i}$ is the set of all morphisms $u\Sub{i}\to v\Sub{i}$ can be rephrased as a universal property: for any family $h\in\Sl{\SET}{I}$ and morphism $\epsilon\Sub{h} : \InvImg{h}u\to\Sub{h} v$ in $\FAM{C}$, there is a unique cartesian map $\InvImg{h}u\to \InvImg{[u,v]}u$ factoring $\epsilon\Sub{h}$ through $\epsilon\Sub{[u,v]}$ in the sense depicted below: To convince ourselves of this, we note that the family $H \coloneqq \brc{u\Sub{i}\to v\Sub{i}}\Sub{i\in I}$ itself satisfies the universal property above. Indeed, fix a candiate $h \in \Sl{\SET}{I}$ equipped with a map $\epsilon\Sub{h} : h^*u \to_h v$. Unfolding the meaning of this map in set theoretical notation, we see that it amounts to a family of maps $\epsilon\Sub{h}[i] : \prod\Sub{x\in h_i} \brc{u_i\to v_i}$ for each $i\in I$; such a family immediately induces the desired map $h\to H$. The definition of local smallness [000I] Based on our explorations above, we are now prepared to write down (and understand) the proper definition of local smallness for an arbitrary fibration $E$ over $B$, which should be thought of as a (potentially large) category relative to $B$. For any $x\in B$ and displayed objects $u,v\in E\Sub{x}$, we define a hom candidate for $u,v$ to be a span $u\leftarrow \bar{h} \rightarrow v$ in $E$ in which the left-hand leg is cartesian: In the above, $h$ should be thought of as a candidate for the “hom object” of $u,v$, and $\epsilon\Sub{h}$ should be viewed as the structure of an “evaluation map” for $h$. This structure can be rephrased in terms of a displayed category $\CandHom{x}{u}{v}$ over $\Sl{B}{x}$: Given $h\in \Sl{B}{x}$, an object of $\CandHom{x}{u}{v}\Sub{h}$ is given by a hom candidate whose apex in the base is $h$ itself. We will write $\bar{h}$ metonymically for the entire hom candidate over $h$. Given $\alpha:l\to h\in\Sl{B}{x}$ and hom candidates $\bar{l}\in \CandHom{x}{u}{v}\Sub{l}$ and $\bar{h}\in \CandHom{x}{u}{v}\Sub{h}$, a morphism $\bar{h}\to\Sub{\alpha} \bar{l}$ is given by a cartesian morphism $\bar\alpha:\bar{l}\to\Sub{\alpha}\bar{h}$ in $E$ such that the following diagram commutes: Definition. A fibration $E$ over $B$ is locally small if and only if for each $x\in B$ and $u,v\in E\Sub{x}$, the total category $\TotCat{\CandHom{x}{u}{v}}$ has a terminal object. Globally small fibrations [000J] In ordinary category theory, a category $C$ is called small when the objects of $C$ can be arranged into a set, and so can for every $x,y\in C$ the collection of morphisms $x\to y$. It is useful to separate these two conditions when we generalize them to fibrations; the first is called local smallness and is discussed and defined in [000F]. The former is called global smallness by Jacobs and factors through an important concept: the generic object. Definition. An ordinary category is called globally small when it has a set of objects. Generic objects [000K] Up to equivalence of categories, we may detect global smallness of a cateogry $C$ from the perspective of the family fibration $\FAM{C}$ [0006]. In particular, a category is equivalent to a globally small category when its family fibration has a generic object in the following sense. Definition. Let $E$ be a fibration over $B$; a generic object for $E$ is defined to be an object $\bar{u}\in \TotCat{E}$ such that for any $\bar{z}\in \TotCat{E}$ there exists a cartesian map $\bar{z}\to \bar{u}$. Globally small categories [000L] Theorem. An ordinary category $C$ is equivalent to a globally small category if and only if the fibration $\FAM{C}$ has a generic object. Proof. To see that this is the case, suppose that $C$ has a set of objects. Then $C\in\SET$ and we define $\lfloor{C}\rfloor$ to be the displayed object $\brc{x}\Sub{x\in C}\in \FAM{C}[C]$. Fixing $I\in \SET$ and $z\in C^I$, we consider the cartesian map displayed over $z : I \to C$: Conversely assume that $\FAM{C}$ has a generic object $\bar{u}\in\FAM{C}[U]$ for some $U\in \SET$; then we may equip $U$ with the structure of a globally small category, such that $U$ is equivalent to $C$. By the axiom of choice we may choose for each $x\in U$ a cartesian map $\InvImg{x}\bar{u}\to\Sub{x}\bar{u}$ over $x:1\to U$; then we say that a morphism $x\to y\in U$ is given by a vertical map $\InvImg{x}\bar{u}\to \InvImg{y}\bar{u}$ in $\FAM{C}[1] \simeq C$. Avoiding the axiom of choice [000M] In some cases we may avoid use of the axiom of choice in [000L]; if our foundations allow us to take the quotient of a class (e.g. using Scott’s Trick), then we may define a morphism $x\to y\in U$ to be given by the following data: a cartesian map $a\to\Sub{x} \bar{u}$ over $x : 1\to U$, a cartesian map $b\to\Sub{y} \bar{u}$ over $y : 1\to U$, and a vertical map $h:a\to b$ in $\FAM{C}[1]\simeq C$, such that $(a\Sub{1},b\Sub{1},h\Sub{1})$ is identified with $(a\Sub{2},b\Sub{2},h\Sub{2})$ when $h_1$ and $h_2$ are equal modulo the (unique) isomorphisms between the cartesian lifts in the sense depicted below: Alternatively, if $C$ is locally small then we may take the quotient above without difficulty as sets are closed under quotients. The definition of global smallness [000P] Definition. A fibration $E$ over $B$ is called globally small when it has a generic object [000K]. Small fibrations and internal categories [000N] The purpose of this section is to develop the relationship between internal categories (categories defined in the internal language of a category $B$) and fibrations over $B$, generalizing the relationship between categories internal to $\SET$ (i.e. small categories) and their family fibrations over $\SET$. Definition. A fibration is called small when it is both locally small [000I] and globally small [000J]. We have already seen in [000G] and [000L] that smallness in the sense of the definition above appropriately generalizes the ordinary notion of smallness for categories over $\SET$. Another perspective on smallness is given by the internal language, in which a category is viewed as an algebra for the “theory of categories” computed in another category with enough structure.

  Locally small fibrations
<a class="slug" href="/math/nodes/000F.html">[000F]</a>
</h2>

<p>There are a number of (equivalent) variations on the definition of a locally
small fibration. We attempt to provide
some intuition for these definitions.</p>

<h3 id="000G">
  Warmup: locally small family fibrations
<a class="slug" href="/math/nodes/000G.html">[000G]</a>
</h3>

<p>An ordinary category $E$ is called <em>locally small</em> when for any $x,y\in E$ the
collection of morphisms $x\to y$ is a set.  This property of $E$ can be
rephrased in terms of its <em>family fibration</em> <a href="/math/nodes/0004.html" class="slug">[0004]</a> $\FAM{E}$ over
$\SET$ as follows.</p>

<p>Consider an index set $I\in \SET$ and two families $u,v\in C^I$. We may define
an $I$-indexed collection $[u,v]\Sub{i\in I}$ consisting (pointwise) of all the
morphisms $u\Sub{i}\to v\Sub{i}$ in $C$:
<span class="antex display"><img style='margin: -0.021ex 0.149ex -0.602ex 0.0ex; height: 2.364ex; width: 25.177ex;' src="/math/antex/5aa69c75a6e8dcc0a4b02001f40fe9c4.svg" /></span></p>

<p>If $C$ is locally small, $[u,v]\Sub{i\in I}$ is in fact a family of sets for
any $I\in\SET$ as each $[u,v]\Sub{i}$ is a set. Conversely, if $[u,v]\Sub{i\in I}$
is a family of sets for any $I\in \SET$, then $C$ is locally small as we may
consider in particular the case that $I=\mathbf{1}$.</p>

<h3 id="000H">
  A more abstract formulation
<a class="slug" href="/math/nodes/000H.html">[000H]</a>
</h3>

<p>We will reformulate the above in a way that uses only the language that makes
sense for an arbitrary fibration, though for now we stick with $\FAM{C}$. Given
$u,v\in \FAM{C}[I]$, we have a “relative hom family” $[u,v]\in\Sl{\SET}{I}$,
defined in <a href="/math/nodes/000G.html" class="slug">[000G]</a>. The fact that each $[u,v]\Sub{i}$ is the set of all
morphisms $u\Sub{i}\to v\Sub{i}$ can be rephrased more abstractly.</p>

<p>First we consider the restriction of $u\in \FAM{C}[I]$ to $\FAM{C}[[u,v]]$ as follows:
<span class="antex display"><img style='margin: 0.002ex 0.029ex -3.019ex 0.0ex; height: 17.557ex; width: 19.367ex;' src="/math/antex/32af0d7286cf47b57fa87bf13b510784.svg" /></span>
Explicitly the family $\InvImg{[u,v]}u$ is indexed in a pair of an element $i\in I$ and a morphism $u\Sub{i}\to v\Sub{i}$.
We can think of $\InvImg{[u,v]}u$ as the object of elements of $u\Sub{i}$ indexed in pairs $(i,u\Sub{i}\to v\Sub{i})$.</p>

<p>There is a canonical map
$\epsilon\Sub{[u,v]}:\InvImg{[u,v]}u\to\Sub{p\Sub{[u,v]}} v$ that
“evaluates” each indexing morphism $u\Sub{i}\to v\Sub{i}$.</p>

<p>That each $[u,v]\Sub{i}$ is the set of all morphisms $u\Sub{i}\to v\Sub{i}$ can be
rephrased as a universal property: for any family $h\in\Sl{\SET}{I}$ and
morphism $\epsilon\Sub{h} : \InvImg{h}u\to\Sub{h} v$ in $\FAM{C}$, there is a
unique cartesian map $\InvImg{h}u\to \InvImg{[u,v]}u$ factoring $\epsilon\Sub{h}$ through $\epsilon\Sub{[u,v]}$
in the sense depicted below:
<span class="antex display"><img style='margin: -0.023ex 0.0ex -18.456ex 0.0ex; height: 27.136ex; width: 37.966ex;' src="/math/antex/c09613ab6c9806acee30a95ea2e878c4.svg" /></span></p>

<p>To convince ourselves of this, we note that the family $H \coloneqq \brc{u\Sub{i}\to v\Sub{i}}\Sub{i\in I}$ itself satisfies the universal property above. Indeed, fix a candiate $h \in \Sl{\SET}{I}$ equipped with a map $\epsilon\Sub{h} : h^*u \to_h v$. Unfolding the meaning of this map in set theoretical notation, we see that it amounts to a family of maps $\epsilon\Sub{h}[i] : \prod\Sub{x\in h_i} \brc{u_i\to v_i}$ for each $i\in I$; such a family immediately induces the desired map $h\to H$.</p>

<h3 id="000I">
  The definition of local smallness
<a class="slug" href="/math/nodes/000I.html">[000I]</a>
</h3>

<p>Based on our explorations above, we are now prepared to write down (and
understand) the proper definition of local smallness for an arbitrary fibration
$E$ over $B$, which should be thought of as a (potentially large) category
relative to $B$.</p>

<p>For any $x\in B$ and displayed objects $u,v\in E\Sub{x}$, we define a <em>hom
candidate</em> for $u,v$ to be a span $u\leftarrow \bar{h} \rightarrow v$ in $E$ in which the left-hand leg is cartesian:
<span class="antex display"><img style='margin: 0.002ex 0.028ex -13.144ex 0.0ex; height: 16.815ex; width: 30.861ex;' src="/math/antex/0bb08b92e5f2492d8cd859ccee3ea226.svg" /></span></p>

<p>In the above, $h$ should be thought of as a candidate for the “hom object” of $u,v$,
and $\epsilon\Sub{h}$ should be viewed as the structure of an “evaluation map” for $h$.
This structure can be rephrased in terms of a displayed category $\CandHom{x}{u}{v}$ over $\Sl{B}{x}$:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Given $h\in \Sl{B}{x}$, an object of $\CandHom{x}{u}{v}\Sub{h}$ is given by a hom candidate
whose apex in the base is $h$ itself. We will write $\bar{h}$ metonymically
for the entire hom candidate over $h$.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Given $\alpha:l\to h\in\Sl{B}{x}$ and hom candidates $\bar{l}\in \CandHom{x}{u}{v}\Sub{l}$ and
$\bar{h}\in \CandHom{x}{u}{v}\Sub{h}$, a morphism $\bar{h}\to\Sub{\alpha} \bar{l}$ is given by a
cartesian morphism $\bar\alpha:\bar{l}\to\Sub{\alpha}\bar{h}$ in $E$ such that the
following diagram commutes:
<span class="antex display"><img style='margin: 0.002ex 0.112ex -8.491ex 0.0ex; height: 17.844ex; width: 24.097ex;' src="/math/antex/92078006dff8ce9e98a116b9fc0be7c0.svg" /></span></p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Definition.</strong> A fibration $E$ over $B$ is <em>locally small</em> if and only if for
each $x\in B$ and $u,v\in E\Sub{x}$, the total category $\TotCat{\CandHom{x}{u}{v}}$
has a terminal object.</p>

<h2 id="000J">
  Globally small fibrations
<a class="slug" href="/math/nodes/000J.html">[000J]</a>
</h2>

<p>In ordinary category theory, a category $C$ is called <em>small</em> when the objects
of $C$ can be arranged into a set, and so can for every $x,y\in C$ the
collection of morphisms $x\to y$. It is useful to separate these two conditions
when we generalize them to fibrations; the first is called <em>local smallness</em>
and is discussed and defined in <a href="/math/nodes/000F.html" class="slug">[000F]</a>. The former is called <em>global
smallness</em> by Jacobs and factors through an important concept: the <em>generic object</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Definition.</strong> An ordinary category is called <em>globally small</em> when it has a set of objects.</p>

<h3 id="000K">
  Generic objects
<a class="slug" href="/math/nodes/000K.html">[000K]</a>
</h3>

<p>Up to equivalence of categories, we may detect global smallness of a cateogry $C$ from the perspective of the family fibration $\FAM{C}$ <a href="/math/nodes/0006.html" class="slug">[0006]</a>. In particular, a category is equivalent to a globally small category when its family fibration has a <em>generic object</em> in the following sense.</p>

<p><strong>Definition.</strong> Let $E$ be a fibration over $B$; a <em>generic object</em> for $E$ is defined to be an object $\bar{u}\in \TotCat{E}$  such that for any $\bar{z}\in \TotCat{E}$ there exists a cartesian map $\bar{z}\to \bar{u}$.</p>

<h4 id="000L">
  Globally small categories
<a class="slug" href="/math/nodes/000L.html">[000L]</a>
</h4>

<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> An ordinary category $C$ is equivalent to a globally small category if and only if the fibration $\FAM{C}$ has a generic object.</p>

<p><strong>Proof.</strong>
To see that this is the case, suppose that $C$ has a set of objects. Then
$C\in\SET$ and we define $\lfloor{C}\rfloor$ to be the displayed object
$\brc{x}\Sub{x\in C}\in \FAM{C}[C]$. Fixing $I\in \SET$ and $z\in C^I$, we
consider the cartesian map displayed over $z : I \to C$:
<span class="antex display"><img style='margin: -0.024ex 0.069ex -2.23ex 0.0ex; height: 14.758ex; width: 33.227ex;' src="/math/antex/f9b6daf1d0c21d371f0388d07c838237.svg" /></span></p>

<p>Conversely assume that $\FAM{C}$ has a generic object $\bar{u}\in\FAM{C}[U]$
for some $U\in \SET$; then we may equip $U$ with the structure of a globally
small category, such that $U$ is equivalent to $C$.  By the axiom of choice we
may choose for each $x\in U$ a cartesian map
$\InvImg{x}\bar{u}\to\Sub{x}\bar{u}$ over $x:1\to U$; then we say that a
morphism $x\to y\in U$  is given by a vertical map $\InvImg{x}\bar{u}\to
\InvImg{y}\bar{u}$ in $\FAM{C}[1] \simeq C$.</p>

<h5 id="000M">
  Avoiding the axiom of choice
<a class="slug" href="/math/nodes/000M.html">[000M]</a>
</h5>

<p>In some cases we may avoid use of the axiom of choice in <a href="/math/nodes/000L.html" class="slug">[000L]</a>; if our foundations allow us to
take the quotient of a <em>class</em> (e.g. using
<a href="http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Scott%27s+trick">Scott’s Trick</a>), then we may
define a morphism $x\to y\in U$ to be given by the following data:</p>

<ol>
  <li>a cartesian map $a\to\Sub{x} \bar{u}$ over $x : 1\to U$,</li>
  <li>a cartesian map $b\to\Sub{y} \bar{u}$ over $y : 1\to U$,</li>
  <li>and a vertical map $h:a\to b$ in $\FAM{C}[1]\simeq C$,</li>
</ol>

<p>such that $(a\Sub{1},b\Sub{1},h\Sub{1})$ is identified with $(a\Sub{2},b\Sub{2},h\Sub{2})$ when $h_1$ and $h_2$ are equal modulo the (unique) isomorphisms between the cartesian lifts in the sense depicted below:
<span class="antex display"><img style='margin: -0.023ex 0.052ex -16.596ex 0.0ex; height: 19.998ex; width: 33.325ex;' src="/math/antex/ad5fe4e2ec0b3a38cda6cdec2eb215e6.svg" /></span></p>

<p>Alternatively, if $C$ is locally small then we may take the quotient above without difficulty as sets are closed under quotients.</p>

<h3 id="000P">
  The definition of global smallness
<a class="slug" href="/math/nodes/000P.html">[000P]</a>
</h3>

<p><strong>Definition.</strong> A fibration $E$ over $B$ is called <em>globally small</em> when it has a generic object <a href="/math/nodes/000K.html" class="slug">[000K]</a>.</p>

<h2 id="000N">
  Small fibrations and internal categories
<a class="slug" href="/math/nodes/000N.html">[000N]</a>
</h2>

<p>The purpose of this section is to develop the relationship between <em>internal
categories</em> (categories defined in the internal language of a category $B$) and
fibrations over $B$, generalizing the relationship between categories internal
to $\SET$ (i.e. small categories) and their family fibrations over $\SET$.</p>

<p><strong>Definition.</strong> A fibration is called <em>small</em> when it is both locally small
<a href="/math/nodes/000I.html" class="slug">[000I]</a> and globally small <a href="/math/nodes/000J.html" class="slug">[000J]</a>.</p>

<p>We have already seen in <a href="/math/nodes/000G.html" class="slug">[000G]</a> and <a href="/math/nodes/000L.html" class="slug">[000L]</a> that smallness in the
sense of the definition above appropriately generalizes the ordinary notion of
smallness for categories over $\SET$. Another perspective on smallness is given
by the <em>internal language</em>, in which a category is viewed as an algebra for the
“theory of categories” computed in another category with enough structure. The
notion of internal categories is credited (independently) to Alexander
Grothendieck and Charles Ehresmann.</p>
